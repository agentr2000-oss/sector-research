## 2. Valuation Multiples

| Metric | Reliance Jio | Bharti Airtel | Vodafone Idea | BSNL | Indus Towers | Tata Communications |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **EV/EBITDA (FY25)** | ~18.7x (implied on $150 bn valuation) | ~16.5x (consolidated) | ~28.6x (on cash EBITDA) | N/A — Govt Entity | ~6.5x | ~13.9x |
| **EV/EBITDA (FY26E)** | ~15-16x (est. with EBITDA growth) | ~13-14x (est.) | ~25x (est., improving losses) | N/A — Govt Entity | ~5.5-6x (est.) | ~12x (est.) |
| **P/E (FY25)** | ~45-50x (implied; Jio PAT ~24,000 Cr est.) | ~55-60x (consolidated; includes Africa) | Negative (net loss) | Negative (net loss) | ~12.5x (PAT INR 9,932 Cr) | ~30-35x (est.) |
| **EV/Subscriber (INR)** | ~24,600 (on 488 mn subs) | ~37,900 (on 369 mn India subs) | ~13,300 (on 198 mn subs) | N/A | N/A — Tower Infra | N/A — Enterprise |
| **EV/Revenue** | ~9.4x | ~8.1x | ~6.0x | N/A — Govt Entity | ~4.5x | ~2.6x |

**Notes:**
- Jio Platforms valuation multiples are estimates based on pre-IPO valuations of $134-170 bn (Jefferies: $180 bn). Actual listed multiples will depend on IPO pricing.
- Bharti Airtel P/E appears elevated due to consolidated results including Africa operations and significant depreciation/amortization from spectrum.
- Vodafone Idea: P/E is not meaningful (NM) as the company continues to report net losses (FY25 net loss ~INR 28,700 Cr).
- BSNL: Valuation multiples not applicable as an unlisted government entity. The company turned a quarterly profit for the first time in 18 years in Q3/Q4 FY25 but is still loss-making on a full-year basis.
- Indus Towers trades at lower multiples typical of tower infrastructure companies with high dividend payout.

| Metric | Reliance Jio | Bharti Airtel | Vodafone Idea | BSNL | Indus Towers | Tata Communications |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|------|-------------|---------------------|

| **Capex/Revenue** | ~23.5% | ~17.5% (India) | ~12% (est.) | ~125% (govt-funded expansion) | ~28.9% | ~7.3% |
| **Net Debt/EBITDA** | ~0.4x (Jio Platforms est.) | ~0.04x (excl. leases); ~2.3x (incl. leases) | ~20x (on cash EBITDA, excl. leases) | — (Govt-supported) | ~0.86x | ~2.8x (est.) |
| **RoCE** | ~10-12% (est.; lower than Airtel due to 5G investment phase) | ~19.5% (H1 FY26) | Negative (loss-making) | Negative (improving) | ~46% | ~15% (est.) |
| **FCF Yield** | Approaching FCF positive (FY26E) | ~2.5% (est.; OFCF ~INR 31,400 Cr) | Negative | Negative | ~7.4% (FCF ~INR 9,144 Cr on mkt cap ~INR 1,24,000 Cr) | ~3-4% (est.; highest-ever FCF in FY25) |
| **Churn Rate (monthly)** | ~0.5% | ~1.8% | ~2.5% | — | N/A — Tower Infra | N/A — Enterprise |
| **Data Usage/Sub (GB/month)** | ~30+ GB (world's largest data network per RIL annual report) | ~22-25 GB (est.) | ~15-18 GB (est.) | — | N/A — Tower Infra | N/A — Enterprise |
| **5G Coverage** | 191 mn 5G subs (Mar-25); 234 mn (Sep-25); nationwide | 135 mn 5G subs (FY25); nationwide metro + urban | 29 cities across 17 circles (launched Q1 FY26) | 5G planned Delhi/Mumbai by Dec-25; 4G rollout ongoing | N/A — Tower Infra (enables 5G via towers) | N/A — Enterprise |
| **Tower Count / Tenancy** | ~4,50,000+ cell sites (own + shared) | ~2,00,000+ own sites; relies on Indus Towers, ATC | ~1,60,000+ sites (est., declining) | ~1,00,000 4G sites (new rollout) | 2,49,305 towers; tenancy ratio 1.63x | N/A — Enterprise (global network infra) |

**Notes:**
- BSNL's capex/revenue exceeds 100% because the government is funding a massive 4G/5G network buildout (~INR 47,000 Cr planned).
- Indus Towers' high RoCE (46%) reflects its asset-light leasing model and improving collections from Vi.
- Jio's data usage per subscriber is among the highest globally, driven by affordable data pricing.
- Vodafone Idea's 5G rollout is highly selective (29 cities) compared to Jio/Airtel's nationwide coverage, constrained by capital limitations.

## 4. Growth Metrics

| Metric | Reliance Jio | Bharti Airtel | Vodafone Idea | BSNL | Indus Towers | Tata Communications |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Revenue Growth (YoY, FY25)** | +17% | +21% (consolidated) | +2.2% | +7.8% | +5.3% | +11.2% |
| **EBITDA Growth (YoY, FY25)** | +17.9% | +27% (EBITDAaL) | +9.5% (cash EBITDA) | +149% (from INR 2,164 Cr to INR 5,396 Cr) | +41.9% | +10% (est.) |
| **Subscriber Growth (YoY)** | +5-6% (~25 mn net adds FY25) | +5 mn to REC base in FY25; strong adds in H2 | Declining (~-10-15% YoY active subs) | Stabilizing at ~91 mn; added 1.4 mn in Aug-25 | N/A — Tower additions: record year | N/A — Enterprise |
| **ARPU Growth (YoY)** | +14% (FY25, driven by tariff hikes Jul-24) | +17% (ARPU rose ~INR 36 YoY to INR 245) | +14% (Q4 FY25, INR 175 vs INR 153) | +20% (est., INR 96 to INR 115) | N/A — Tower Infra | N/A — Enterprise |

**Notes:**
- ARPU growth across the sector was primarily driven by the industry-wide tariff hike of July 2024 (15-25% increase by all operators).
- BSNL's EBITDA surge (+149%) reflects government recapitalization effects and cost restructuring alongside 4G launch.
- Indus Towers' strong EBITDA growth (+41.9%) was driven by improved collections from Vodafone Idea and record tower/tenancy additions.
- Vodafone Idea's revenue growth (+2.2%) significantly lags the industry, reflecting continued subscriber losses offsetting ARPU gains.

## 5. Completeness Tracker

### Completeness by Company

| Company | Cells Filled | Total Cells | Completeness |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Reliance Jio | 27 | 28 | ~96% |
| Bharti Airtel | 28 | 28 | ~100% |
| Vodafone Idea | 26 | 28 | ~93% |
| BSNL | 17 | 28 | ~61% |
| Indus Towers | 20 | 28 | ~71% |
| Tata Communications | 18 | 28 | ~64% |
| **Overall** | **136** | **168** | **~81%** |

### Key Data Gaps

1. **Reliance Jio:** Exact standalone net debt of Jio Platforms (vs. RIL consolidated) is estimated pending IPO disclosures. RoCE and FCF yield are analyst estimates.
2. **Bharti Airtel:** India-only EBITDA (ex-Africa) not separately disclosed in all sources; some figures use consolidated data.
3. **Vodafone Idea:** Exact FY25 capex figure not confirmed in public sources; guided capex for FY26 used as proxy. Enterprise value is distorted by massive debt relative to market cap.
4. **BSNL:** Most financial metrics limited due to unlisted status. Revenue market share, ARPU, churn rate, and data usage are rough estimates. No EV or valuation multiples applicable.
5. **Indus Towers:** Subscriber, ARPU, churn, and data usage metrics are N/A as a tower infrastructure company. Revenue market share not applicable.
6. **Tata Communications:** Subscriber, ARPU, churn, data usage, and 5G metrics are N/A as an enterprise/infrastructure player. Net debt and RoCE are estimates.

## Key Observations

1. **Duopoly Formation:** India's telecom market has effectively consolidated into a Jio-Airtel duopoly, commanding ~75% subscriber share and an estimated ~75%+ of wireless revenue. Vodafone Idea and BSNL continue to lose subscribers.

2. **ARPU Convergence with Gap:** Airtel leads on ARPU (INR 245-256) reflecting a premium subscriber mix, while Jio's ARPU (INR 206-211) is rising but still ~20% lower. Both benefit from the Jul-24 tariff hike. Vi trails at INR 175-180.

3. **Jio IPO Catalyst:** The planned Jio Platforms IPO (H1 CY2026, $134-170 bn valuation) is a major sector event that could re-rate Airtel and the broader sector as a transparent pricing benchmark emerges.

4. **Vodafone Idea Survival Risk:** With net debt/EBITDA of ~20x and continued subscriber losses, Vi's viability depends on government support (AGR relief, debt-to-equity conversion) and successful 5G rollout with limited capital.

5. **Infrastructure Value:** Indus Towers stands out with 46% RoCE, 7.4% FCF yield, and low leverage (0.86x net debt/EBITDA), benefiting from 5G-driven tower demand. It trades at just ~6.5x EV/EBITDA vs. 16-19x for operators.

6. **BSNL Revival:** BSNL posted its first quarterly profits in 18 years (Q3-Q4 FY25) and is executing a record government-funded capex program (INR 26,000+ Cr), but remains a distant fourth in the market.
